🔍 What it shows
Stat	Details
Item counters	Every item the location can drop – auto-discovered from the location info page.
# of Explores	Normal clicks plus the extra explores bundled into Apple Cider.
Stamina used	Real stamina delta after Wanderer perk etc.
Apple Cider / Arnold Palmer	Counts every use.
Full-inventory marker	Items you can’t pick up (grey icons) turn red-tinted – and un-tint automatically once space is free.

Numbers are formatted with a dot as thousands separator ( 12 345 → 12.345 ).

⚙️ Controls
Per-location “Reset” button – sits on the same line as the stats.

Clears the counts only for the current area and immediately starts tracking again.

Global reset – press the game’s own top-bar “refresh” ↻ icon.

Wipes all sessions & “full” flags for every area at once.

Everything else is automatic – enter an area, the tracker appears; leave it, the box disappears; come back, it rebuilds.

🛠️ How to install
Install Tamper-monkey (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).

Press “Create New Script”, paste the code, hit Save.

Refresh FarmRPG and start exploring – the box pops up under the action buttons.

Tested on the latest desktop browsers. Uses only local storage; nothing is sent anywhere.

✅ Why it’s safe
No automation – it never clicks or sends requests for you.

Read-only – counts what your browser already received.

Minimal footprint – observer-free, lean intervals, icon cache to cut network.

Enjoy the instant feedback and happy farming!
